# Challenge Week 2

## Description

I have created a website portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS files in order to expose and organise my present and future projects.
It contains 5 parts: the header with my name and the navigation bar, the hero banner with a short description and my avatar, the work section which contains the projects I've already implemented and some placeholders for the next, the contact section where I included my details and the Resume section where I attached the CV.
